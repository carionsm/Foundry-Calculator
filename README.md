# Foundry Calculator

This is the repostory for the [Foundry Calculator](https://erkle64.github.io/Foundry-Calculator/calc.html), a tool for calculating resource requirements and production ratios in the game [Foundry](https://www.foundry-game.com/).
It is adapted from [Factorio Calculator](https://kirkmcdonald.github.io/calc.html).

## Running locally

The calculator consists entirely of static files (HTML, JS, CSS), and may be run locally using any HTTP server. If you have Python 3 installed, you can start a simple development server on port 8000 with:

```text
$ python3 -m http.server 8000
```
